# Scrollytelling Template
A component-based rich media / scrollytelling template made with Svelte.

The easiest way to build a project from this template is to clone it using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), which just creates a local copy of the files (not a Git branch).

If you don't have **degit**, you can install it from NPM.
```bash
npm install -g degit
```

Then run the following command to clone this template (replace `your-project` with a name for your project folder).
```bash
degit ONSvisual/svelte-scrolly your-project
```

Next, open the folder and install the dependencies to get started.
```bash
cd your-project
npm install
```

You can then start a local development server to see live changes as you edit the template. It will run on **http://localhost:5000/** and should update every time you save changes to a file.
```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally. When you're done creating your project, you can compile it. (You'll find the compiled code in the `public` folder).
```bash
npm run build
```
